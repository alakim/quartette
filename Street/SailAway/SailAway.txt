[Intro]

Em


[Verse]

Em
If you're drifting on an empty ocean

Em
With no wind to fill your sail

Em
The future, your horizon

Em
It's like searching for the holy grail

Em
You feel there's no tomorrow

Em
As you look into the water below

Em
It's only your reflection

Em
And you still haven't got no place to go


[Pre-Chorus]

B    A    G
Time will show

Em    D       C
When, I don't know


[Chorus]

Am           Em
Sail away tomorrow

Am           Em
Sailing far away

   Am                Em
To find and steal or borrow

G        A        B
I'll be there someday

B          Em
Yeah, yeah


[Verse 2]

Em
Oh woman, I keep returning

Em
To sing the same old song

Em
The story's been told, now I'm getting old

Em
Tell me, where do I belong?

Em
Feel like I'm going to surrender

Em
Hard times I've had enough

Em
If I could find a place to hide my face

Em
I believe, I could get back up


[Pre-Chorus]

B    A    G
Time will show

Em    D       C
When, I don't know


[Chorus]

Am          Em
Sail away tomorrow

Am          Em
Sailing far away

Am                  Em
To find it steal or borrow

G             A       B
But I'll be there someday

B
Yeah, yeah, yeah

[Chorus]

Am          Em
Sail away tomorrow

Am          Em
Sailing far away

Am                  Em
To find it steal or borrow

G             A       B
But I'll be there someday

B
Yeah, yeah, yeah

[Chorus]

Am          Em
Sail away tomorrow

Am          Em
Sailing far away

Am                  Em
To find it steal or borrow

G             A       B
But I'll be there someday

B
Yeah, yeah, yeah
